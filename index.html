  <h2>About the Event</h2>
  <p>In the Cardboard F1 Challenge, you’ll help build a cardboard F1-style race car and compete to win!</p>
  <p>When signing up, you choose which race type you want to join:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Down a Hill</strong> – gravity-powered</li>
    <li><strong>On a Mini Track</strong> – pedal-powered (no motors!)</li>
    <li><strong>Both Events</strong> – participate in both on different days</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You’ll be placed into a team with others who chose the same race type. If you pick both events, you’ll be placed in <strong>two different teams</strong> — one for each day.</p>
  <p>💵 <strong>The $20 entry fee must be paid in cash at the event location. No online payments.</strong></p>
  <p>The first team to finish the course with someone riding inside their car wins! Only the winning team receives <strong>certificates</strong>. Team names will be voted on at the event.</p>
  <p><strong>No materials will be provided onsite</strong> — bring lots of tape, strong glue, cardboard, wood, and creativity! You can also bring wheels connected to axles — just make sure they fit your build. If you want to use power tools, <strong>you must bring your own</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Collision Rules & Penalties</h2>
  <p>Any collisions during the race will be thoroughly investigated by event officials.</p>
  <p>Drivers found to be responsible for causing collisions may face penalties, such as time additions, dropping positions, or disqualification.</p>
  <p><strong>If a driver is disqualified, it only applies to that round</strong> – they may still participate in future rounds.</p>
  <p><strong>Mini Track Special Rule:</strong> If you're disqualified during a mini track race, your racing number will be shown with a <strong>black background</strong>, and you must switch drivers during the next pit stop before continuing.</p>
  <p>You may block other racers, but <strong>blocking is risky</strong> — you could crash or lose multiple positions. Block at your own risk.</p>
  <p>Our goal is to ensure a fun, safe, and fair competition for everyone—so please race responsibly!</p>
